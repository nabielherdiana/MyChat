## 🔐 Privacy First — Like, Actually

This is the part where we get serious for a sec:

> **Your chat data NEVER leaves your device.**

Here's how it works:
- ✅ All processing happens **100% in your browser**
- ✅ **No servers involved** — we literally can't see your data even if we wanted to
- ✅ No accounts, no sign-ups, no tracking
- ✅ Open source — you can check the code yourself!

**TL;DR:** Your embarrassing 3 AM texts are safe with us. Because we never even see them. 🙈
